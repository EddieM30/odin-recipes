    <h2>Mom's Favorite Baked Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p>This creamy baked mac and cheese recipe is one I first made three years ago when I was in California. When I got back to Texas, I made it for my mom. This is now her favorite macaroni and cheese. She begs me to make it when I come to visit.</p>
